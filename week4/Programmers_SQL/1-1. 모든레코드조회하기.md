ANIMAL_ID순으로 조회하는 SQL문을 작성해주세요. 

```SQL
SELECT * FROM ANIMAL_INS
ORDER BY ANIMAL_ID;
```

```SQL
SELECT WAREHOUSE_ID, WAREHOUSE_NAME, ADDRESS, 
    CASE 
        WHEN FREEZER_YN IS NULL THEN "N"
        ELSE FREEZER_YN
    END AS FREEZER_YN
FROM FOOD_WAREHOUSE
WHERE ADDRESS LIKE "%경기도%"
ORDER BY WAREHOUSE_ID;
```
